Welcome to the %OpenMesh documentation. %OpenMesh is a generic and efficient library
that offers data structures for representing and manipulating polygonal meshes.
It is a powerful tool for handling polygonal
meshes. Due to its inherent generative structure it allows the user to
create mesh types which are custom tailored to the specific needs of
the application. The user can either supply his own data structures
for representing vertices, edges and faces or he can conveniently use
the predefined structures of %OpenMesh.
Additionally %OpenMesh offers dynamic properties allowing the user to attach
and detach data to the mesh during runtime.
    
Here you can find information on how to build projects using the %OpenMesh library
as well as further information on mesh handling in %OpenMesh.
The tutorials explain how to use %OpenMesh by demonstrating real code examples.

We provide a short overview over the functionality of the %OpenMesh
library and some additional concepts in \ref tutorial. Additionally, we explain the 
most important topics of %OpenMesh in the following sections:

\li \ref mesh_features
\li \ref mesh_hds
\li \ref mesh_iterators
\li \ref mesh_navigation
\li \ref mesh_io
\li \ref mesh_operations
\li \ref mesh_hierarchy

This section is supposed to introduce the basic concepts of
%OpenMesh. <!--For detailed information, consult the online documentation
(\subpage mesh_docu ).-->

<!--In this tutorial we will introduce the %OpenMesh library by means of
simple examples. The first one just builds a polygonal mesh
representing a cube and writes the result to standard output. The
following examples develop a simple mesh smoother: Recall that the
immediate neighbors of a vertex are called the 1-ring of this
vertex. It is well known that a polygonal mesh can be smoothed by
repeatedly replacing each vertex' position by the center of gravity
(cog) of its 1-ring. The basic smoother will

\li read a polygonal mesh from standard input,
\li compute the cog of the 1-ring of each vertex,
\li replace each vertex' position by its cog and finally,
\li write the mesh to standard output.-->
