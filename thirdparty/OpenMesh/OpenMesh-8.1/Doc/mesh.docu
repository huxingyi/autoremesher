/** \page mesh_first_to_read Notes on template programming

Please note, that %OpenMesh makes heavily use of C++ templates,
generic programming and all that stuff (see \ref mesh_cpp).  Therefore
read this section carefully (else you get lost in the reference
manual):

<h3>There is no such thing like the %OpenMesh class</h3>

The library provides a set of classes ( 99% templates ;-) ), where the
inheritance relationship is given by template parameterization. You
might ask: "What the heck is that?" It means, a parent class is passed
as a template argument to another class:

\code
class P1 { }
class P2 { }
template <typename Parent> class B : public Parent {}

typedef B<P1> fooB1;
typedef B<P2> fooB2;
\endcode

Voila, we have created two different types of B. Depending on the
interface, the public member elements, provided by \c P1 or \c P2, \c
fooB1 and \c fooB2 might have different behaviours or even different
interfaces! But if \c P1 and \c P2 have the some interface or at least
a common interface, then from programming point of view there is no
difference using \c fooB1 or \c fooB2. And this is all
about. %OpenMesh defines an interface concept for the kernel which is
documented in \ref OpenMesh::Concepts::KernelT. As long as the kernel
provides this the class handling polygonal meshes \c
OpenMesh::PolyMeshT can use any kernel.

<h3>Therefore documentation resides in two spaces</h3>

-# Associated with the class/struct (as usual)
-# In a concept class in cases like the example code above. Hence, if you want
   to know what a mesh type has to offer refer to OpenMesh::Concepts::KernelT,
   OpenMesh::PolyMeshT, OpenMesh::TriMeshT.

/** \page mesh_features Features and Goals of OpenMesh

The main features of the underlying data structure are:

\li  No restriction to triangles meshes, handle general polygonal meshes.
\li  Explicit representation of vertices, halfedges, edges, and faces.
\li  Efficient access to the one-ring neighborhood of a vertex.
\li  Ability to handle non-manifold vertices (like two faces meeting in only
     one vertex).


The goals/features of the C++ implementation are:

<ul>
<li> Flexibility:
    <ul>
    <li>  Choose suitable types for scalars and coordinates (e.g. float,
	  double, exact arithmetic and two-, three-, or n-dimensional
	  points).</li>
    <li>  Enhance each item type by your own attributes/properties, like
          e.g. adding a normal vector or a \c FaceHandle to class \c
          Vertex.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Efficiency:
    <ul>
    <li>  Avoid the overhead of virtual inheritance and virtual function calls.</li>
    <li>  Resolve as many type/attribute dependencies as possible at
          compile-time instead of testing for attributes at run-time
          (e.g. normal vectors for faces).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Type-safety for handles, <b>no type-casting (*)</b>: Vertices,
     (Half-)Edges, Faces know each other and their corresponding
     handles.

     <b>(*)</b> Since version 0.10.0 the Microsoft VisualC++ compiler is
     supported. Due to the compilers inaptitude to process forwards on template
     functions correctly, the type-safety had to be given up to some extend.
     Though under the hood void pointers are used, the casting is done
     within the mesh, and the user transparently uses his handles as before.<br>
     As soon as the compiler adheres to the C++ standard the type-safe version
     will be restored.</li>
</ul>
*/


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


/** \page mesh_cpp Some words on the C++ implementation

If one takes a look at the goals and features section it soon becomes
obvious that these goals cannot be achieved using trivial C++ features
only. We make heavy use of templates, (partial) template specialization,
generative and generic programming, and the STL. This may be a challenge
for you as well as for your compiler, as these are quite late features
of the C++ language.

While knowledge of generative programming is only necessary if you
want to create your own mesh kernels or extend iterators or similar
types, you will \b NOT need it for simply using these things.
Nevertheless working knowledge of C++ and basic knowlege of templates
is required. To get into this stuff we recommend the following
books:

\li Bjarne Stroustrup, <em> The C++ Programming Language </em>,

\li Matthew H. Austern, <em> Generic Programming and the STL: Using
    and Extending the C++ Standard Template Library </em>,

\li Andrei Alexandrescu, <em> Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming
    and Design Patterns Applied </em>,

/** \page mesh_hds The Halfedge Data Structure

This section describes the underlying data structure that is used to
store the mesh entities (items) vertices, edges, faces, and their
connectivity information.  There are many popular data structures used
to represent polygonal meshes. For a detailed comparison of them refer
to the papers at the end of this section.

The data structure used in this project is the so called <em> halfedge
data structure </em>. While <em> face-based </em> structures store
their connectivity in faces referencing their vertices and neighbors,
<em> edge-based </em> structures put the connectivity information into
the edges. Each edge references its two vertices, the faces it belongs
to and the two next edges in these faces. If one now splits the edges
(i.e. an edge connecting vertex \c A and vertex \c B becomes two <em>
directed halfeges </em> from \c A to \c B and vice versa) one gets a
<em> halfedge-based </em> data structure. The following figure
illustrates the way connectivity is stored in this structure:

<table>
<tr valign=top>
  <td> \image html halfedge_structure3.png
  <td>
<ul>
<li> Each \b vertex references one outgoing halfedge, i.e. a halfedge that
  starts at this vertex (1).
<li> Each \b face references one of the halfedges bounding it (2).
<li> Each \b halfedge provides a handle to
  <ul>
  <li> the vertex it points to (3),
  <li> the face it belongs to (4)
  <li> the next halfedge inside the face (ordered counter-clockwise) (5),
  <li> the opposite halfedge (6),
  <li> (optionally: the previous halfedge in the face (7)).
  </ul>
</ul>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

Having these links between the items, it is now possible to circulate
around a face in order to enumerate all its vertices, halgedges, or
neighboring faces. When starting at a vertex' halfedge and iterating
to the opposite of its previous one, one can easily circulate around
this vertex and get all its one-ring neighbors, the incoming/outgoing
halfedges, or the adjacent faces. All this functionality is
encapsulated into the so-called <em> circulators </em>, described in
\ref mesh_iterators.

\attention In order to efficiently classify a boundary
vertex, the outgoing halfedge of these vertices <b> must be a boundary
halfedge </b> (see OpenMesh::PolyMeshT::is_boundary()).
\attention Whenever you modify the
topology using low-level topology changing functions, be sure to
guarantee this behaviour (see
OpenMesh::PolyMeshT::adjust_outgoing_halfedge())

While one does not need to store the previous halfedge (7) explicitly,
because it can be derived from the links to the next halfedges, one
may do so for the sake of performance. In fact, the previous halfedge
is stored by default (OpenMesh::DefaultTraits). Using traits and
attributes the previous halfedge can removed, to gain memory. This
kind of mesh customization is explained in \ref mesh_type.

While the halfedge-based structures usually consume more memory than
their face-based counter-parts they have the following important
advantages:

\li It is easy to mix faces of arbitrary vertex count in one mesh.

\li We now have an explicit representation of vertices, faces, \em and
    edges/halfedges. This becomes extremely useful if one has to store data
    per edge/halfedge since this can easily be modelled by member
    variables of these types (see \ref mesh_type).

\li Circulating around a vertex in order to get its one-ring neighbors is an
    important operation for many kinds of algorithms on polygonal meshes.
    For face-based structures this leads to many <tt>if-then</tt> branchings,
    the halfedge structure provides this funcionality without
    conditional branching in constant time.

/** \page mesh_hierarchy Conceptual Class Hierarchy

Since there is no such thing as a %OpenMesh class and the library
makes heavy use of C++ template, we show the inheritance graph of
OpenMesh::TriMesh_ArrayKernelT as proxy for all possible mesh types.

Please note! Most of the inheritence relationships are realized by
template parameterization! Therefore some of the inheritance links are
not documented in a inheritance graph in the reference. This picture
shows the overall concept.

\image html class-hierarchy2.png

\section ch_kernel Building the kernel

-# The BaseKernel defines the basic operations on properties like
add/remove/access.
-# Next the AttribKernelT adds the standard properties all associated
methods.
-# Finally the ArrayKernelT provides the methods to add/remove/access
the mesh items vertices, (half-)edges, and faces. The base class is passed
as a template parameter, since depending on the underlying storage type the
AttribKernel might change.

\section ch_complete Building the mesh

-# The PolyMeshT inherits from the kernel and provide all necessary methods
to work with polygonal meshes.
-# Finally we derive TriMeshT from PolyMeshT to have an specialization for
triangle meshes.

Looks simple, but it isn't - it's a bit more complicated:

\include build-trimesh.cc

To generate the actual mesh type the helper template class \c
TriMesh_ArrayKernel_GeneratorT is used. It takes the traits in a
template argument and passes it to \c FinalMeshItemsT to get the final
type of the mesh items (MeshItems).  The \c MeshItems defines the
types for Point, Normal, Color, TexCoord, Vertex, and for all mesh
items.  With the help of \c MeshItems create the type of the \c
AttribKernel, which defines the apropriate standard properties for the
items.  Finally use \c AttribKernel and \c MeshItems to create the
mesh kernel type \c MeshKernel. It's quite a way to get a kernel . As
long as the created kernel follows the kernel concept (\ref
mesh_kernels_group), we can easily create now the mesh. Here we
use now \c TriMeshT to create the final mesh type \c Mesh.

/** \page mesh_type Specifying your MyMesh

This section will show how to build your own custom tailored type \c
MyMesh. As we have seen in the section on goals and features there are
some parameters to be specified for a mesh. This is done in the
following four steps:

<ol>

<li> Choose between triangle mesh and general polygonal mesh.

<li> Select the mesh kernel

<li> Parameterize the mesh by a so-called \em Traits class. You can
add arbitrary classes to the mesh items, specify the types \c Scalar,
\c Point, \c Normal and \c Color, and use predefined attributes like
\c Attributes::Normal and \c Attributes::Color.

<li> Dynamically bind data to the mesh or the mesh entities (vertex,
(half-)edge, face) using \em custom \em properties.

</ol>

We will explain these four parameterization steps and give a code
example at the end of this page.

<br><br>

\section sec_select_face_type Polygonal or Triangle Mesh?

This decision is quite simple: Whenever possible choose the triangle
mesh. The restriction to triangular faces usually leads to more
efficient algorithms (e.g. rendering triangles is much faster than
rendering arbitrary polygons). Additionally some algorithms are only
implemented for triangle meshes while triangle meshes inherit the full
functionality of polygonal meshes. For a list of them refer to the
following links.

\see OpenMesh::PolyMeshT
\see OpenMesh::TriMeshT



<br><br>

\section sec_select_kernel Choosing the right kernel

The mesh kernel specifies how the mesh entities (vertices,
(half-)edges, faces) are internally stored. In fact the entities are kept in
so-called properties. A property itself provides an array like interface.
The kernel defines the corresponding handle types,
i.e. the way items reference each other. Since the properties have an
array like interface the handles are represented internally as indices.

The default kernel is \c ArrayKernelT. Which is good for most
situations. But depending on the application a different kernel would
be better. E.g. the OpenSG integration has been realized be replacing
the kernel by a custom kernel, since OpenSG provides already array like
properties, which could be reused for the intergration. In case of a an OpenSG
environment one might be better off using \c OSG_Kernel::ArrayKernelT.

\see \ref mesh_kernels_group

<br><br>

\section sec_select_traits Mesh Traits

While the last two sections only have chosen from a list of predefined
meshes or kernels, respectively, we now come to the user-defined
customization.

The resulting mesh \c MyMesh will provide the following types:

<ul>
<li> The <i>point</i> and <i>scalar</i> type: \c MyMesh::Point and \c
     MyMesh::Scalar.
<li> The <i>mesh items</i>: \c MyMesh::Vertex, \c MyMesh::Halfedge, \c
     MyMesh::Edge, \c MyMesh::Face.
<li> The <i>handle</i> types: \c MyMesh::VertexHandle, \c
     MyMesh::HalfedgeHandle, \c MyMesh::EdgeHandle, \c
     MyMesh::FaceHandle.
</ul>

While the handle types are fixed, the other types can be customized.
Each mesh type (see \ref mesh_types_group) can be parameterized
by a so-called \em traits class. Using this mechanism one can

<ol>
<li> change the coordinate type \c MyMesh::Point and the resulting
     scalar type \c MyMesh::Scalar == \c MyMesh::Point::value_type,
<li> change the normal type \c MyMesh::Normal
<li> change the color type \c MyMesh::Color
<li> use predefined attributes like normal vector, color, texture
     coordinates, ... for the
     mesh items.
<li> add arbitrary classes to the mesh items.
</ol>

All these customizations are encapsulated in one class \c MyTraits,
that is used as template argument to the mesh, e.g.
\code
struct MyTraits {
  // your customization
};
typedef PolyMesh_ArrayKernelT<MyTraits>  MyMesh;
\endcode

The rest of this section explains the construction of this traits
class, its application to the mesh will be the topic of the next section.

For each mesh entity one can control the predefined attributes to be
attached by a traits class using some convenience macros, e.g.  \c
OpenMesh::VertexAttributes and \c OpenMesh::VertexTraits for
vertices. The default traits class looks like this:

\include traits0.cc

Please note that for example \c VertexTraits is a define concealing a
template declaration. The actual template class name is \c VertexT,
which is further simplified to a specific type \c Vertex at a later
stage during the construction of the mesh kernel.

Because the traits classes always have to provide the template classes
\c VertexT, \c HalfedgeT, \c EdgeT, \c FaceT, and the types \c Point,
\c Normal, \c Color, and \c TexCoord one should derive this class from
the default implementation \c DefaultTraits. In this case you will
only have to define the classes or types you want to override or substitute.


<br>
\subsection sec_change_point Changing the Point type

Changing the type that is used to store the point coordinates as well
as the normal vectors can simply be done by defining this type in the
traits class. The following code changes the coordinate type in order
to use \c double instead of \c float.

\include traits1.cc

Using the OpenMesh::VectorT class you can easily plug in any scalar
type for the use in point coordinates, e.g. some exact arithmetic. You
can also exchange the whole class representing points as long as it
provides the same interface as the OpenMesh::VectorT class.


<br>
\subsection sec_add_attributes Adding Predefined Attributes

There are some pre-defined attributes that can be appended to the mesh
items. These global attributes are defined in the namespace
OpenMesh::Attributes. The advantage of these attributes is that
they are registered at the items they are added to. Therefore
algorithms can check for these attributes at run-time as well as at
compile-time. This is important if you want to implement algorithms
acting on different meshes, that may or may not have e.g. normal
vectors per vertex/face.

Adding these predefined attributes is quite simple. You provide an
<tt>unsigned int</tt> in the traits class, whose bits control whether
or not a certain attribute should be attached or not.

If you want to add a normal vector to your vertices and faces, and also
want to have color information for vertices, the code would look like this:

\include traits5.cc

Internally each mesh item contains an \c enum defining the integer \c
Attributes (containing the bits of used attributes OR'ed
together). From its set/unset bits you can see whether a certain
attribute is used. OpenMesh provides the macro OM_Check_Attrib for
doing this:

\code
if (OM_Check_Attrib(MyMesh::Vertex, Normal)
  do_something_with_normals();
\endcode

These run-time checks may not be sufficient in some cases. You can also check
for attributes at compile-time and instantiate the correct functions
by using function overloading. The class \c GenProg::Bool2Type maps
true/false information to two different types, \c Bool2Type<true> and
\c Bool2Type<false>. An example that draws OpenGL normals if they are
available would look like this:

\include draw_normals.cc

Especially the compile-time checking for attributes is extremely
useful because it does not generate any unnecessary code and does not
perform expensive tests at run-time.

\see OpenMesh::DefaultTraits
\see OpenMesh::Attributes
\see OpenMesh::GenProg

<br>
\subsection sec_add_traits Adding User-Defined Elements

You can also add arbitrary types/elements/methods to the mesh items by
providing a corresponding traits class for these items. Adding some
index to the \c Vertex class is easily done by

\include traits2.cc

The macro \c VertexTraits hides some ugly template stuff. In fact, it
is defined as

\code
#define VertexTraits template <class Base, class Refs> struct VertexT : public Base
\endcode

hence the traits class actually looks like this:

\include traits3.cc

You have to keep this in mind when you want to define constructors for
your vertex type or when you want to derive the vertex type from other
classes.

The template argument \c Base provides access to the mesh handles and
to the \c Point and \c Scalar type by its member class \c Refs. Adding
a \c MyMesh::FaceHandle to the vertex class can therefore be
implemented like this:

\include traits4.cc

Adding elements to other mesh items works in the same manner.


<br>
\subsection sec_algo_traits Using traits defined by algorithms

From version 0.10.3 on algorithms can define traits/attributes they
require and the user can merge these traits into his own traits. A more elegant
way is to use dynamic properites, which can be added/removed during runtime
by the algorithm. This is the preferred way to attach custom data to the mesh.

An example for an algorithm as well as the application using traits
is given in \ref tutorial_06.

<br><br>

\section sec_properties Dynamic Properties

From version 1.0 on %OpenMesh provides dynamic properties. Instead of
using traits to bind data at compile time algorithms or the
application can use dynamic properties. Similar to entities the properties
are accessed and manipulated via handles.

An example for an algorithm as well as the application using
properties is given in \ref tutorial_03 and \ref tutorial_04.

<br><br>

\section sec_traits_example Final Implementation Example

Consider an application where we just want to render triangle meshes.
This means we will select the triangle mesh and the \c
ArrayKernelT. Faces that are not triangles will automatically be
tesselated into triangles. Because we only display meshes and do not
dynamically add or remove items, we can just use the \c ArrayKernelT.

All mesh-kernel combinations are predefined in the directory
<tt>%OpenMesh/Mesh/Types</tt>. Refer to \ref mesh_types_group for a
complete list of them. For our example we use the \c
TriMesh_ArrayKernelT and parameterize it by our \c MyTraits class.

We will need face and vertex normals and e.g. for color coding vertex
curvature, i.e. vertex color.

\include mymesh.cc

That's it.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/** \page mesh_eigen Specifying an OpenMesh using Eigen3 vectors

This section will show how to build your own custom mesh type using
Eigen3 vectors for points, normals or other entities.

First of all you need to include the Eigen header shipped with OpenMesh:
\code
#include <OpenMesh/Core/Geometry/EigenVectorT.hh>
\endcode

This header contains the external functions and vector traits used by
OpenMesh. 

Afterwards you can specify your mesh:

\code
struct EigenTraits : OpenMesh::DefaultTraits {
    using Point = Eigen::Vector3d;
    using Normal = Eigen::Vector3d;

    using TexCoord2D = Eigen::Vector2d;
};

using EigenTriMesh = OpenMesh::TriMesh_ArrayKernelT<EigenTraits>;

EigenTriMesh mesh;

\endcode

Now you can use mesh as any other OpenMesh while using Eigen vectors
as the underlying data type.

\note OpenMesh uses stl vectors for storing its data. This might lead to errors
      regarding memory alignment with sse instructions:
      http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TopicStlContainers.html
      You might need to define -DEIGEN_DONT_VECTORIZE  

*/


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


/** \page mesh_members Where do I find a list of all member functions ?

The following picture shows the (simplified) conceptual inheritance
diagram for the %OpenMesh classes.

\image html inheritance-simple.scaled.png

The basis for all meshes is the corresponding \c MeshKernel, taking
care of the internal storage of the mesh items (vertices,
(half-)edges, faces). This kernel is inherited by the \c PolyMeshT,
i.e. the general polygonal mesh, adding higher level
functionality. For specialization purposes the class \c TriMeshT is
derived from \c PolyMeshT and overrides some member functions or adds
functions only suitable for pure triangle meshes.

In most cases a class (e.g. \c PolyMeshT) gets the class it should
derive from (e.g. the mesh kernel) as a template parameter. The
documentation class OpenMesh::Concepts::MeshKernel::KernelT lists the
minimal interface a mesh kernel must provide. Special kernels may
provide some more functionality, in this case refer to this kernel's
documentation (see \ref mesh_kernels_group). Therefore your mesh
provides the pubic member functions of

<ul>
<li> The mesh kernel.</li>
<li> The general polygonal mesh.</li>
<li> The specialized triangle mesh (if you use a TriMesh instead of a PolyMesh).</li>
</ul>

/** \page mesh_io Read and write meshes from files

This section explains the methods used to read a mesh from a file or
write it to a file. The corresponding functions are defined in the
namespace OpenMesh::MeshIO. This section is divided into three steps.
Step one will give a short example on how to use the %OpenMesh IOManager,
step two will give some background information on how IOManager works and
finally step three will show you how to add your own modules to IOManager.

A tutorial with more information regarding file IO can be found here: \ref tutorial_08

\section mesh_io_quick Step 1 - IOManager quick start

For a quick start you can copy the following code directly to your project.

\note
<ul>
<li>If you link statically against OpenMesh, you have to add the define
OM_STATIC_BUILD to your application. This will ensure that readers and writers
get initialized correctly.</li>
<li>IOManager uses the filename extension to determine which reader/writer
to use. I.e. if passing "inputmesh.obj" as filename parameter, the OBJ-File
reader/writer will be used to parse/write the file.</li>
</ul>

\include mesh_io.cc


<br><br>

\section mesh_io_theory Step 2 - The theory behind IOManager

Usually mesh reader and writer routines are written directly against
the data structure and the respective file format they support. This
approach has the main disadvantage that targeting a different data
structure or adding another file format leads to duplication of code.

IOManager acts as an interface between persistent data on one side and
an arbitrary data structure on the other side by means of reader/writer
and importer/exporter modules. This is illustrated by the following
diagramm :

\image html iomanager.png

<br>

Persistent data of arbitrary format is first interpreted by a reader
module. The data is then passed - by means of a specified interface -
to an importer module for the target data structure. The process for
writing data is analogous. The IOManager controls the entire process.
Reader/Writer modules are invisible to the user. Importer/Exporter
however have to be specified explicitely as they are specific to a
data structure.

The complete separation of data structure and persistent data makes it
especially easy to maintain existing code and to extend funtionality
at both ends as will be shown in step three.

\see OpenMesh::IO::_IOManager_

<br><br>

\section mesh_io_extend Step 3 - How to extend IOManager

\subsection mesh_io_extend_fileformat Adding support for a new file format

Adding support for a new file format involves adding a reader and
writer module.  Reader modules are classes derived from
OpenMesh::IO::BaseReader. The part of the interface that you
usually have to define is shown below.

\include BaseReader.hh

Based on the file extension or the header information the IOManager
decides which reader module to use. The reader then parses the format
and the information will be passed to the target data structure be
means of a class derived from OpenMesh::IO::BaseImporter.

Writer modules are derived from OpenMesh::IO::BaseWriter and work
the same way as reader modules.

<br>

\subsection mesh_io_extend_datastruct Adding support for a new data structure

As we have already seen, Importers receive information from the reader modules.
Reader modules pass information through a specified interface :

\include BaseImporter.hh

The Importer is then responsible for filling the target data structure.
Exporting information from a data structure is a little bit more involved than
importing data to it. The writer modules must be able to iterate over all
vectors/texcoords/faces. Therefore an exporter has to provide these iterators :

\include BaseExporter.hh

There might be the need for the exporter to cache data from the structure it
refers to. The update() function should be called at the beginning of
each BaseWriter::save() method and it should make sure that cached information
is up to date.

For further information you are encouraged to take a look at the modules
provided by %OpenMesh which can be found in the IO subdirectory.

/** \page mesh_iterators Mesh Iterators and Circulators

- \ref it_iters
- \ref it_iters_h
- \ref it_iters_skipping
- \ref it_circs
- \ref it_circs_h

\section it_iters Iterators

The mesh provides linear iterators (that enumerate vertices,
halfedges, edges, and faces). These can be used to easily navigate
through a mesh. Each iterator \c XYZIter also exists in a const
version \c ConstXYZIter.

All iterators are defined in the namespace
OpenMesh::Iterators. They are template classes that expect a mesh as
template argument to be fully specified. You should use the
iterator types provided by the mesh itself, i.e. \c MyMesh::VertexIter instead of \c
OpenMesh::Iterators::VertexIterT<MyMesh>.

The iterators are:

\include iterators.cc

The corresponding \c const counterparts are

\arg \c ConstVertexIter,
\arg \c ConstHalfedgeIter,
\arg \c ConstEdgeIter,
\arg \c ConstFaceIter.


The linear iterators are conformant to STL iterators. For a
description of their interface see OpenMesh::Concepts::IteratorT.

When using iterators, use the pre-increment operation (++it) for efficiency
reasons. 

\deprecated
While it is possible to use \c handle() to get the handle of the item referred
to by the iterator, this function is deprecated. Simply dereference the iterator
instead.

\subsection deletedElements Deleted Elements
If no elements of a mesh are marked as deleted, the indices provided by \c idx()
are consecutive numbers from 0 to <I>number of elements</I>-1 (in the case of vertices this would be
from 0 to n_vertices()-1).

However, note that this is <B>not</B> the case when elements are marked
as deleted and OpenMesh::ArrayKernel::garbage_collection() has not yet been called.

After garbage_collection() has been called the elements are reorganized and their handles and
iterators are guaranteed to be consecutive numbers again.

OpenMesh uses a lazy deletion scheme to avoid unnecessary updates to the data structure. The 
halfedge data structure will always be updated directly to ensure that following algorithms 
will have the correct iterator setups.

So if you delete a face, The face itself will still exist but the halfedges which are now located at
the hole will be updated directly, which means that circulators on the adjacent vertices will not
come across the face anymore.

If an edge is deleted, the adjacent faces will be removed as well (flagging them deleted and updating
the surrounding halfedges). The edge itself will also be flagged as deleted. Again the circulators will 
not see the deleted primitives anymore.

For a vertex, all adjacent faces and edges are deleted with the schemes above and the vertex flagged as deleted.

The iterators, going across vertices edges and faces will still enumerate all primitives (including deleted ones).
Except if you use the skipping iterators, which will skip deleted primitives. The circulators always only enumerate 
primitives which are not deleted.


\note

\section it_iters_h How to use iterators in OpenMesh

This example shows how to iterate over all faces of a mesh:

\code

MyMesh mesh;

for(MyMesh::FaceIter f_it = mesh.faces_begin(); f_it != mesh.faces_end(); ++f_it) {
    std::cout << "The face's valence is " << mesh.valence( *f_it ) << std::endl;
}

\endcode

\section it_iters_skipping Skipping Iterators
All iterators are also available as skipping iterators. If elements are deleted on a mesh,
the standard iterators go over all elements, even deleted ones(which are available until
a garbage_collection is done). The skipping iterators ignore these elements. You can retrieve
a skipping iterator by calling one of the following functions:

\arg \c vertices_sbegin(),
\arg \c edges_sbegin(),
\arg \c halfedges_sbegin(),
\arg \c faces_sbegin()

The ends for these iterators are equal to the standard iterator ends (e.g. \c vertices_end() ).

\section it_circs Circulators

%OpenMesh also provides so called Circulators that
provide means to enumerate items adjacent to
another item of the same or another type.
For example, a \c VertexVertexIter allows to enumerate all vertices
immediately adjacent to a (center) vertex (i.e. it allows
to enumerate the so-called 1-ring of the center vertex).
Analogously, a \c FaceHalfedgeIter enumerates all the
halfedges belonging to a face.
In general, \c CenterItem_AuxiliaryInformation_TargetItem_Iter
designates a circulator that enumerates all the target items
around a given center item.

The constructor of a circulator is of the form
\c Circulator(MeshType mesh, TargetHandle center_handle),
i.e. it takes a mesh and the handle of the item to circulate
around.

The circulators around a vertex are:

\arg \c VertexVertexIter: iterate over all neighboring vertices.
\arg \c VertexIHalfedgeIter: iterate over all \em incoming halfedges.
\arg \c VertexOHalfedgeIter: iterate over all \em outgoing halfedges.
\arg \c VertexEdgeIter: iterate over all incident edges.
\arg \c VertexFaceIter: iterate over all adjacent faces.

The circulators around a face are:

\arg \c FaceVertexIter: iterate over the face's vertices.
\arg \c FaceHalfedgeIter: iterate over the face's halfedges.
\arg \c FaceEdgeIter: iterate over the face's edges.
\arg \c FaceFaceIter: iterate over all edge-neighboring faces.

Other circulators:
\arg \c HalfedgeLoopIter: iterate over a sequence of Halfedges. (all Halfedges over a face or a hole)

All circulators provide the operations listed in
CirculatorT<Mesh>, which are basically the same as the
iterator funtions.

\note Circulators are similar to bidirectional iterators and therefore they have the bidirectional_iterator_tag.
However, the bidirectional requires that the attribute OpenMesh::Attributes::PrevHalfedge is available.
Otherwise it is just a forward iterator.

\deprecated
While it is possible to use \c operator \c bool(), which returns true, as long
as the circulator hasn't reached the end of the sequence, this function is
deprecated. Use the function \c is_valid() instead.

%OpenMesh provides the following functions (defined in OpenMesh::PolyConnectivity)
to get circulators around a specified center item:

\include circulator_functions.cc

Additionally to the normal circulators there exists some for each
direction (clock-wise, counterclock-wise). Those circulators might be slower
than the normal one, but the direction of circulation is guaranteed.
You can get these types of circulators by adding the infix "ccw" or "cw" to
the function used to request the circulator of an item after the underscore.
Example:

\code
VertexVertexIter vvit = mesh.vv_iter(some_vertex_handle);          // fastest (clock or counterclockwise)
VertexVertexCWIter vvcwit = mesh.vv_cwiter(some_vertex_handle);    // clockwise
VertexVertexCCWIter vvccwit = mesh.vv_ccwiter(some_vertex_handle); // counter-clockwise
\endcode

It is also possible to convert a cw circulator to a ccw circulator and vice versa.
For this purpose, each circulator provides a constructor taking the other circulator as input.
If a cw circulator is converted, the ccw circulator points on the same element as
the cw circulator pointed on, but the direction for the increment and decrement changed.\n
The conversion is only valid for valid circulators. The resulting circulator from a invalid circulator is still invalid,
but might behave in a fashion not expected by normal iterators. Example:
\code
  VertexVertexCWIter vvcwit = mesh.vv_cwend(some_vertex_handle);
  VertexVertexCCWIter vvccwit = VertexVertexCCWIter(vvcwit); //conversion of an invalid circulator
   --vvcwit;  //is valid now (if the range >= 1)
   ++vvccwit; //can still be invalid
\endcode

CW and CCW circulators requires that OpenMesh::Attributes::PrevHalfedge is available.


\note For every circulator there also exists a constant version.
To make use of these constant circulators just add the prefix<br />
"Const" to the type specifier and add the prefix "c" to the function used to request
the circulator of an item. Example:<br/>

\code
ConstVertexVertexIter cvvit = mesh.cvv_iter(some_vertex_handle);
\endcode

\note When constructing Circulators from iterators, make sure you don't create
a circulator of an deleted element(e.g. FaceVertexiter of a deleted Face), as
this will lead to unpredictable behaviour. Using skipping iterators for iterating over
the elements and creating circulators from them is safe as they don't contain
deleted elements.

\section it_circs_h How to use circulators in OpenMesh

The following code example now shows how to enumerate the 1-ring of each vertex:

\include circulators.cc

Enumerating all halfedges adjacent to a certain face (the inner halfedges) is accomplished
as follows:

\code

MyMesh mesh;

...

// Assuming faceHandle contains the face handle of the target face

MyMesh::FaceHalfedgeIter fh_it = mesh.fh_iter(faceHandle);

for(; fh_it.is_valid(); ++fh_it) {
    std::cout << "Halfedge has handle " << *fh_it << std::endl;
}

\endcode
