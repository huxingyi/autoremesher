/** \page tutorial_10 Storing custom properties

The %OpenMesh' proprietary OM format allows to store and restore
custom properties along with the standard properties. For it we have
to use named custom properties like the following one

\dontinclude 10-persistence/persistence.cc
\skipline VPropHandleT
\skipline mesh.add_property

Here we registered a float property for the vertices at the mesh with
name "vprop_float". The name of a property, that we want to make
persistent, must follow a few rules

-# max. 256 characters long
-# The prefixes \c "v:", \c "h:", \c "e:", \c "f:" and \c "m:" are reserved.

If we stick to this rules we are fine. Furthermore we have to
consider, that the names are handled case-sensitive.

To actually make a custom property persistent we have to set the
persistent flag in the property with

\skipline mesh.property(vprop_float).set_persistent

Now we can use \c IO::mesh_write() to write the mesh to a file on
disk.  The custom properties are added after the standard properties
in the file, with the name and it's binary size. These two pieces of
information are evaluated when reading the file again. To successfully
restore the custom properties, the mesh must have registered named
properties with equal names (case-sensitive compare). Additionally,
when reading the data, the number of bytes read for a property must
match the provided number in the file. If the OM reader did not find a
suitable named property, it will simply skip it. If the number of bytes
do not match, the complete restore will be terminated and \c
IO::read_mesh() will return \c false. And if the data cannot be
restored, because the appropriate restore method is not available the
exception std::logic_error() will be thrown.

Since we now know the behaviour, we need to know what kind of data can
we store?  Without any further effort, simply using named properties
and setting the persistent flag, we can store following types

- bool, stored as a bitset
- all other fundamental types except long double, (unsigned) long and size_t
- std::string, each up to 65536 characters long
- OpenMesh::Vec[1,2,3,4,6][c,uc,s,us,i,ui,f,d]

For further reading we call these types basic types. Apparently we
cannot store non-basic types, which are

- pointers
- structs/classes
- even more complex data structures, like container of containers.

However there is a way to store custom types ( else we could not store
std::string). Let's start with an more simple custom data. For
instance we have a struct \c MyData like this

\dontinclude 10-persistence/persistence.cc
\skipline struct MyData
\until vec4fval
\skipline };

Here we keep an int, bool, double value and a vector of 4 floats, which
are all basic types. Then we need to specialize the template struct
OpenMesh::IO::binary<> within the namespace \c OpenMesh::IO

\skipline binary<MyData>

Remember not to use long double, (unsigned) long and size_t as basic types
because of inconsistencies between 32/64bit architectures.

Herein we have to implement the following set of static member
variables and functions:

\skipline is_streamable
\skipline size_of
\skipline size_of
\skipline store
\skipline restore

The flag \c is_streamable has to be set to \c true. Else the data
cannot be stored at all. 

<h5>\c size_of methods </h5>

Since the size of the custom data can be static, which means we know
the size at compile time, or the size of it is dynamic, which means me
the size is known at runtime, we have to provide the two \c size_of()
methods.

The first declaration is for the static case, while the second for the
dynamic case. Though the static case is more simple, it is not
straight forward. We cannot simply use \c sizeof() to determine the
data size, because it will return the number ob bytes it needs in
memory (possible 32bit alignment). Instead we need the binary size,
hence we have to add up the single elements in the struct.

\dontinclude 10-persistence/persistence.cc
\skipline return sizeof

Actually we would need to sum up the single elements of the vector,
but in this case we know for sure the result (4 floats make 16 bytes,
which is 32bit aligned therefore \c sizeof() returns the wanted
size). But keep in mind, that this a potential location for errors,
when writing custom binary support.  

The second declaration is for the dynamic case, where the custom data
contains pointers or references. This static member must properly
count the data, by disolving the pointers/references, if this data has
to be stored as well. In the dynamic stetting the static variant cannot return
the size, therefore it must return \c IO::UnknownSize.

In this case the dynamic variant simply returns the size by calling the static
variant, as the sizes are identical for both cases.

<h5>\c store /  \c restore </h5>

For the dynamic case as for the static case, we have to make up a
scheme how we would store the data. One option is to store the length
of the data and then store the data itself. For instance the type \c
std::string is implemented this way. (We store first the length in a
16bit word (=> max. length 65536), then the characters follow. Hence
\c size_of() returns 2 bytes for the length plus the actual length of
the value \c v.) Since \c MyData contains only basic types we can
implement the necessary methods \c store and \c restore, by simply
breaking up the data into the basic types using the pre-defined
store/restore methods for them:

\skipline static size_t store
\until }
\skipline static size_t restore
\until }

It's very important, that the store/restore methods count the
written/read bytes correctly and return the value. On error both
functions must return 0.

A more complex situation is given with the following property

\dontinclude 10-persistence/persistence.cc
\skipline MyMap
\skipline mprop_map

In this case the data contains a container, a map from strings to
integer numbers. If we want to store this as well, we need to make up
a scheme how the map will be stored in a sequential layout. First we
store the number of elements in the map. Then, since the map has an
iterator, we simply iterate over all elements and store each pair
(key/value). This procedure is equal for the \c size_of(), \c store(), and \c
restore() methods. For example the \c size_of() methods look like this

\dontinclude 10-persistence/persistence.cc
\skip binary< MyMap >
\skipline static size_t size_of
\skipline static size_t size_of
\until }
\until }

The implementation of \c store() and \c restore() follow a similar pattern.

The given example program does the following steps

-# Create a mesh and generate a cube
-# Add a few custom properties
-# Fill them with test data
-# Make the properties persistent
-# Store mesh in a file named 'persistent-check.om'
-# Clear the mesh
-# Restore mesh
-# Check the content on equality with the test data.

Since the example is a little bit longer than usual the source is in
several files. The main program is in \c persistence.cc, the cube
generator in \c generate_cube.hh, \c stats.hh provides little tools to
display information about the mesh and the properties, the file \c
fill_props.hh providing the test data, and \c int2roman.hh/.cc, which
is used in fill_props.hh.  All necessary parts are in \c
persistence.cc, which is displayed in full length below. For the other
files please have a look in the directory \c
OpenMesh/Doc/Tutorial/10-persistence/.
